# Dead-coral-removal-experiment

Code and datafiles for experiment involving the effects of removing dead coral on the growth and survival of live coral, as well as development of macroalgae. The experiment was conducted in Moorea, French Polynesia from 2019 - 2023, following a major coral bleaching event in April 2019. The code contained here was used to generate analyses and figures for a published dissertation chapter and manuscript in prep entitled "Clearing a path to resilience: removal of dead coral mitigates downstream impacts of coral bleaching".

In the "Data" folder, there are three main data files that were used for analyses in the above mentioned manuscript. [Regions_master.csv]([https://github.com/kkopecky711/Dead-coral-removal-experiment/blob/main/Data/Regions_master.csv])
